    "# Speaker-Independent Spoken Digit Recognition (xSDR)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the successful stories of deep neural networks is the proliferation of commercial of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This project aims to explore one application of ML-powered ASR to the problem of spoken digit recognition (SDR). Since digits are widely used as unique identifiers for bank information, social security numbers, post codes, etc, SDR systems can be an efficient alternative to fully-fledged ASR systems since the domain is more predictable than other applications of ASR. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on developing a SDR system in a speaker-independent setting. That is, the speakers in the evaluation set are disjoint from the training set speakers. We do so because we expect real-world ASR systems to generalize to different speakers than those we have data for. Moreover, for many languages that are under-resourced, we have have (limited) annotated speech data from a single speaker, but we would still want the system to be deployed to work on any speaker of that language. We tackle the problem of spoken digit recognition as a sequence classification task. Concretely, the inputs are short audio clips of a specific digit (in the range 0-9), then the goal is to build deep neural network models to classify a short audio clip and predict the digit that was spoken."

    "## Code Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't necessarily need to complete the code in this Jupyter Notebook, you are free to use another notebook or a python script file, as you would like. You are expected to submit the code by **22.03.2023**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should be clean and well commented. We also expect that if we decide to run it on our system, it should be straighforward to do so. We recommend creating a ```requirements.txt``` file with the names of all the libraries with their versions. If applicable, please mention the python version in a ```README.md``` file, which should also include instructions on how to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned for the assignments, always remember to cite the code with the links as comments, if you decide to use it from a public repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "With the code, you are also expected to submit a report with a maximum of 4 pages. You should write your report in LaTeX using this template for ACL 2023 [Overleaf Link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2023-proceedings-template/qjdgcrdwcnwp). Use this document to fill in any missing information that are not necessarily covered during your presentation for the sake of time in the presentation. While writing your report, we would highly encourgae you to cite the papers behind each tool / library / function that you might use for your experiments. We have also released an example on how to write equations in LaTeX [here](https://piazza.com/class/l9so16qqvk34hu/post/52).\n",

    "\n",
    "During the last week of March 2023, i.e. 27.03 -- 31.03, each team will be presenting their works for 15 minutes. We expect equal contribution from each member in delivery and content of the presentation. So roughly 5 minutes for one person, if you have 3 people in your team. There will be 5 minutes for some Q&A. At-least one person from your team should be present to do an in-person presentation, rest of your team could join remotely, if they are not present.\n",

For machine learning applications, human speech is represented using spectro-temporal features in the [Mel-scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) extracted from the speech sample. Mel-scale features are inspired by human speech perception and auditory processing whereby the human ear has difference sensitivity (or resolution) in differet frequency bandes. That is, the human ear can better recognize differences in in lower range frequences, while higher range frequences have a lower resolution. The Mel-scale is linear for frequencies in the range (0-1kHz), and logarithmic for frequencies above 1kHz.\n",

Each spectral vector $\\mathbf{x}^t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ at time-step $t$ is extracted from a short speech segment (~25 milliseconds) with the assumption that the signal is time-invariant in this small time window. Here, $k$ is the number of frequency bands in the [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram) and this is a parameter of the feature extraction pipeline. The representation is based on the Fourier transform to convert the temporal signal into the frequency domain. \n",

    "1. One problem with the spectrogram as a speech feature represetation is that different speech samples would have dfferent durations due to inherent speech variability (e.g., speech rate, speaker dialect, etc). That is, the $T$ in the $(T \\times k)$-dimensional representation would be different for each sample. Therefore, for the baseline model, we will implement a method to have a fixed-size representation for all speech samples. Write a function downsample_spectrogram(X, N) that takes as input a spectrogram $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times k}$ and a parameter N <= 25. The function should (1) make N equally-sized splits of S across the time-axis, (2) apply a pooling technique (e.g., mean pooling) to each split across the frequency axis to obtain an array that represents a downsampled version of the spectrogram $\\mathbf{X}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times k}$, and (3) re-arange $\\mathbf{X}'$ as a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{Nk}$.    \n",

    "## Task II\n",
    "1. Having established a baseline with a linear model trained on a downsampled signal representation of the speech segment, this task aims to learn a classifier based on the full speech segment. To this end, you will implement a neural model that is suitable for sequential data such as recurrent DNN, convolutional DNN with 1-D temporal convolution, or an audio transformer. The model should take the acoustic sample as it is (i.e., the Mel spectrogram could have an arbitrary length) without the need to downsample the segment. You need to implement at least two of the aforementioned models. Do the neural models improve accuracy over the baseline model? Do you observe any signs of overfitting to the training data? How do the hyperparameters affect the model performance? Report and discuss your observations.        \n",

Compare to the downsampled representation you used in the baseline and report your observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are the differences between the different models statistically significant? To answer this question, you need to implement a statistical significance test based on bootstrapping method. To read more how to estiame p-values based on bootstrapping, we recommend the materials on this paper https://aclanthology.org/D12-1091.pdf. Include the baseline model in your evaluation. "

    "## Task III (Open Ended)\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Even though a model is trained on a single speaker, we would like the model to generalizes to any speaker. To this end, one can use data augmentation techniques to artificially create more samples for each class. Some of these augmentations can be applied on the spectrogram (e.g., SpecAugment https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/04/specaugment-new-data-augmentation.html), and other can be applied on the raw waveform before creating the spectrogram such as pitch manipulation (https://github.com/facebookresearch/WavAugment). Explore the effect of one type of augmentation from each type. Report your observation and anaylze the confusion matrices.\n",

Implement at least one model using a contrastive loss based on different views of the training samples. Does this model improve over the model without contrastive learning? Report and discuss your observations. \n",
